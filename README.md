This is a prototype portfolio site using a Gatsby Starter for style. Pages related to art and performances may be auto generated. This infrastructure may be ported to a different starter or custom Gatsby project; I was just looking to save time on the front end.


Image-heavy photography portfolio with colorful accents & customizable pages. Includes adaptive image grids powered by CSS grid and automatic image integration into projects. Using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-jodie`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-jodie).
